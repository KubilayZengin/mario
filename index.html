Rather than relying on a single, general-purpose AI solution, AI agent orchestration employs a network of AI agents, each designed for specific tasks, working together to automate complex workflows and processes.",
                "Multi-agent systems (MAS) emerge when multiple AI agents collaborate, either in a structured or decentralized manner, to solve complex tasks more efficiently than a single agent might. In practice, AI agent orchestration functions like a digital symphony. Each agent has a unique role and the system is guided by an orchestrator—either a central AI agent or framework —that manages and coordinates their interactions.",
                "As AI systems grow more advanced, a single AI model or agent is often insufficient for handling complex tasks. Autonomous systems frequently struggle to collaborate because they are built across multiple clouds and applications, leading to siloed operations and inefficiencies. AI agent orchestration bridges these gaps, enabling multiple AI agents to work together efficiently and ensuring that sophisticated tasks are run seamlessly.",

Some agents focus on business and customer-facing tasks like billing, troubleshooting, scheduling and decision-making, while others handle more technical functions like natural language processing, data retrieval and process automation."
